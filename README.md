# MAP-Housing-ATO-Calculator-Weber

The Housing Location Explorer can assist housing and land use planning efforts throughout Weber County. This tool is intended to be used as a conversation starter, helpful visualization, and data-informed guide about access and planning for housing opportunities. Users choose what factors are important to their community and prioritize them. The tool produces a heat map of most to least suitable locations based on the user's prioritization. 

This tool was produced as part of the Weber County Housing Affordability and Access Initiative .
